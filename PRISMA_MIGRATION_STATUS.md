# ‚ö†Ô∏è PRISMA MIGRATION STATUS

## What Happened to Prisma?

‚úÖ **SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED** - Prisma has been completely migrated to direct PostgreSQL queries

## Files Cleaned Up:
- ‚ùå `prisma/schema.prisma` - DELETED (schema moved to `lib/database.js`)
- ‚ùå `prisma/seed.js` - DELETED (moved to `lib/init-db.js`)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `prisma/dev.db` - Still exists but **IGNORED** (SQLite database file)

## Why is `dev.db` still there?
The SQLite database file remains because:
1. **File is locked** by running Node.js processes
2. **Already ignored** in `.gitignore` 
3. **Not needed** for deployment (PostgreSQL used instead)
4. **Safe to keep** - won't affect production

## Migration Complete ‚úÖ
- All API routes use PostgreSQL queries (`lib/database.js`)
- All data exported and ready for Neon import
- No Prisma dependencies in `package.json`
- Ready for Vercel deployment

## Manual Cleanup (Optional)
If you want to remove `prisma/dev.db` manually:
1. Stop all Node.js processes
2. Delete the file: `del prisma\dev.db`
3. Remove directory: `rmdir prisma`

**The app works perfectly without Prisma! üéâ**
